    "For now, consider just the first claw machine in the list:\n",

    "    Pushing the machine's A button would move the claw 94 units along the X axis and 34 units along the Y axis.\n",
    "    Pushing the B button would move the claw 22 units along the X axis and 67 units along the Y axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "The cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the A button 80 times and the B button 40 times. This would line up the claw along the X axis (because 80*94 + 40*22 = 8400) and along the Y axis (because 80*34 + 40*67 = 5400). Doing this would cost 80*3 tokens for the A presses and 40*1 for the B presses, a total of 280 tokens.\n",

    "For the third claw machine, the cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the A button 38 times and the B button 86 times. Doing this would cost a total of 200 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the most prizes you could possibly win is two; the minimum tokens you would have to spend to win all (two) prizes is 480.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we will need to use an integer linear programming approach. We want to find integer solutions for each machine that would allow us to align the claw with the prize by pushing two buttons A and B. Each button move affects the X and Y coordinates by different amounts, and each type of button has a different token cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Convert this into an optimization problem:\n",
    "    - Minimize the cost function: `cost = 3 * a + 1 * b` where `3` is the cost of pressing A and `1` is the cost of pressing B.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check for solutions for all machines using integer constraints up to 100 presses for each button.\n",
