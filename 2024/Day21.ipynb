    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Keypad Layouts:**\n",
    "   - Robots type on a numeric keypad using a positional starting point (`A`).\n",
    "   - The control we have to influence the robots is also using a directional keypad with a specified layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mapping Movement to Output:**\n",
    "   - Map each possible movement from a particular key press sequence to the resultant key the robot would press on the numeric keypad.\n",
    "   - This involves simulating the movements and ensuring the robotic arm never moves into a gap where no button is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shortest Path Calculation:**\n",
    "   - For each code, use a pathfinding algorithm such as BFS or A* to determine the shortest sequence of directional keypad presses starting from its home position `A` and resulting in the correct presses on the numeric keypad.\n",
    "   - Since there may be more than one shortest path, we simply need any one valid path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the \"Complexity\" for Each Code:**\n",
    "   - Complexity of a single code = (Length of the shortest sequence) * (Numeric part of the code).\n",
    "   - The numeric part excludes leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sum of Complexities:**\n",

    "\n",
    "- `generate_sequence(code)` generates the sequence of commands for the first robot to type the numeric code.\n",
    "- `generate_control_robot_sequence()` takes the output from the previous sequence and simulates the second robot's directional keypad commands to control the first robot.\n",
    "- The `control_robot_sequence` provides how you instruct the second robot to achieve programming the first robot correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows our robots to function autonomously based on your stated layout and restrictions.\n",

    "Let's start from the initial setup where the first robot on the numeric keypad starts with its arm at the `A` button. We need the second robot, which controls the first robot, to start its operation with its arm also at its respective `A` button. This setup ensures both robots are in their initial positions ready to be programmed with commands.\n",

    "### Plan for the Control Robot:\n",

    "1. **Initial Mapping:** Define the starting coordinates of the control robot's arm, which would be `(0, 1)` (the position of `A` on its control keypad).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Moves:** When prompted to move the arm to press a button on its own keypad (i.e., `<`, `>`, `^`, `v`, `A`), it translates to adjusting the arm's position and possibly pressing buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate Sequences:** Use the sequence we determined for the first robot to type `029A`, and simulate how the control robot must move to generate each of those commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Keypad Layouts:**\n",
    "   - Robots type on a numeric keypad using a positional starting point (`A`).\n",
    "   - The control we have to influence the robots is also using a directional keypad with a specified layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mapping Movement to Output:**\n",
    "   - Map each possible movement from a particular key press sequence to the resultant key the robot would press on the numeric keypad.\n",
    "   - This involves simulating the movements and ensuring the robotic arm never moves into a gap where no button is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shortest Path Calculation:**\n",
    "   - For each code, use a pathfinding algorithm such as BFS or A* to determine the shortest sequence of directional keypad presses starting from its home position `A` and resulting in the correct presses on the numeric keypad.\n",
    "   - Since there may be more than one shortest path, we simply need any one valid path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the \"Complexity\" for Each Code:**\n",
    "   - Complexity of a single code = (Length of the shortest sequence) * (Numeric part of the code).\n",
    "   - The numeric part excludes leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sum of Complexities:**\n",

    "- **Keypad Boundaries:** We define a set of valid positions on the keypad.\n",
    "- **Movement Logic:** We checked each permutation of moves to ensure the resulting path remains within these valid positions.\n",
    "- **Validation Function:** `is_valid_path` function checks each step to see if it lands on an acceptable position, avoiding crashes.\n",
    "- **Permutation and Path Validation:** Only sequences that keep the robot within valid positions are added to the results.\n",

    "This ensures all sequences generated are safe for the robot to execute without causing an error due to invalid positions.\n",

    "Okay these permutations need to be executed by a robot, this robot has another keypad to manage it can you create the sequence to press the permutation; for this robot there will also be different permutations which require the same approach\n",

    "+---+---+---+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Execute:\n",
    "1. **Keypad Position Mapping:** Each direction (`^`, `v`, `<`, `>`, `A`) is mapped to its respective position on this keypad.\n",
    "2. **Instruction Translation:** Convert each movement in the permutation sequence into corresponding movements on the second keypad. Each character in the sequence (e.g., `^`, `<`) is reached and issued by the second robot.\n",

    "- **Recursive and Cached:** We use `@lru_cache` to cache results of the `generate_control_sequences` for repeated calls with the same parameters. \n",
    "- **Deeper Structure:** Each permutation of actions includes further nested lists for each step. Each step can have multiple valid permutations, each being recursively calculated.\n",
    "- **Tuple Conversion:** Lists are converted to tuples for cacheability, because lists are mutable and can�t be used with `lru_cache` directly.\n",
