    "\n",
    "Great! It looks like you've implemented a code solution to find and evaluate shortcuts on the given racetrack, where programs can cheat by going through walls for up to 20 picoseconds. You have a function to calculate the potential savings of each possible cheat and then determine how many cheats save a minimum amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through what the code is doing and make sure it aligns with your objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`parse_map()`**: Converts the racetrack input into a 2D grid, which is easier to work with programmatically.\n",
    "- **`find_positions()`**: Finds and returns the start 'S' and end 'E' positions in the grid.\n",
    "- **`bfs()`**: A BFS function that calculates the shortest path from a start position to any of the `targets`, avoiding specified prohibited cells.\n",
    "- **`generate_rhombus()`**: Creates a rhombus-shaped pattern (bounded by 20 cells) from any given position. This pattern represents the possible cells that can be reached with a cheat.\n",
    "- **`calculate_savings()`**: Computes the time saved by each possible shortcut. It finds partial paths from start to cheat start, cheat end to end, and then calculates savings by comparing to the original path time.\n",
    "- **`count_shortcuts_with_savings()`**: Counts how many cheats result in a time saving over a specified threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main script then assembles these components, calculates the shortcut savings, and outputs the number of shortcuts saving significant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you might refine the results and output it clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grid = parse_map(racetrack)\n",
    "shortcut_savings = calculate_savings(grid)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display results focusing on keys and their savings time\n",

    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: \n",
    "   - Ensure that the BFS paths are explored optimally, especially since you're allowing up to 20-cell deviations for cheats.\n",
    "   - If there are larger maps, consider implementations that optimize BFS checks to avoid redundant calculations or use memoization where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation**:\n",
    "   - Verify the grid boundaries in `generate_rhombus()` because incorrect conditions might lead to incorrect shortcut paths.\n",
    "   - Ensure the paths calculated actually respect the game's moving rules, particularly returning to a valid track cell after the cheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input Handling**:\n",
    "   - If your input's dimensions might change or you have multiple input cases, it might be wise to add input validation or prepare the function for extensions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should successfully give you the list of significant shortcut savings and a count of those that exceed your defined threshold. Let me know if there are any specific areas or edge cases you'd like to explore further!\n",
    "\n",
    "## User\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay new approach.\n",
    "First create a dictionary with the key the coordinate and the value being the shortest score from the coordinate till the finish. Next to this create a second dictionary with the key the coordinate and the value being the shortest score till the coordinate from the start. \n",
    "After having built these dictionary start cheating. This means that for every coordinate (key) you try to find all possible next level keys that are less then 20 steps away passing only through #. Using this approach start calculating the new route speed by taking the value of the first dictionary for the end of the cheet and taking the value of the second dictionary for the time of the start of the shortcut, increase this with the length through # as the time taken cheating\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clever approach that optimizes the computation by precalculating the shortest paths from the start and to the end of the racetrack for all coordinates. This way, you can focus on evaluating possible cheating shortcuts, leveraging precomputed distances to rapidly evaluate possible cheat paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can implement this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Precompute Shortest Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **From Start to Each Coordinate**: Use BFS to compute the shortest paths from the start position (`S`) to all other coordinates in the grid. Store these distances in a dictionary (`start_to_coord`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **From Each Coordinate to End**: Similarly, perform BFS from the end position (`E`) to all other coordinates but in reverse (you can think of this like a BFS where you start at `E` and explore backwards). Store these distances in another dictionary (`coord_to_end`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Evaluate Cheating Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each possible start of a cheat (each open track cell `.`), determine all possible end positions reachable within 20 steps, passing only through walls `#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the `start_to_coord` and `coord_to_end` dictionaries to compute the total time of the shortcut route and compare it with the original time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Track the time savings for the cheat paths that result in a valid solution.\n",
