A suitable algorithm for this kind of task is the A* algorithm, which is similar to Dijkstra's but uses heuristics to find the shortest path more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step outline to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse the Maze:** First, read the maze input and identify the start position ('S'), the end position ('E'), and any walls ('#') in the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Directions and Costs:** Define possible directions (East, North, West, South) and the respective turning costs. For moves:\n",
    "   - Moving forward costs 1 point.\n",
    "   - Turning right or left costs 1000 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heuristic for A* Algorithm:** Use Manhattan distance from the current position to the end position as a heuristic. This works well because it provides a good estimate of the minimum number of steps to reach the end if there were no obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement A*:**\n",
    "   - Use a priority queue to always expand the path with the lowest estimated total cost (current cost + heuristic).\n",
    "   - Keep track of the score for each path, updating only if a lower score is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **State Representation:** At each step, keep track of the current position, the current facing direction, and the accumulated cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Explore Moves:** For each state:\n",
    "   - Attempt moving forward if possible and add resultant states to the priority queue.\n",
    "   - Consider both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations, updating the direction and score appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Store Result and Path:** When reaching the end ('E'), compare the score and retain the best (lowest score) path found.\n",

    "3. **Prune Strategies:** During exploration, if a move adds to the path cost that exceeds the best-known path cost, that move is abandoned early.\n",

    "### Key Improvements:\n",
    "- **Efficiency in Calculation:** Backward tracing from the endpoint considers only viable paths maintaining the optimal calculated cost, which is more efficient.\n",
    "- **Unified Tile Collection:** Collects all unique tiles visited by such optimal paths.\n",
    "- **Reduced Operations:** Reduces excess operations by only expanding necessary nodes on valid trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "These refinements should significantly enhance the speed, maintaining correctness while ensuring all valid paths are fully considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you add a skip clause that if the item of the stack has been visited before it is just skipped\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! We can enhance the backward path tracing by ensuring that each state (position and direction) is only processed once. This not only avoids unnecessary recomputation but also significantly enhances performance by skipping redundant evaluations. Here's how we can incorporate this improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visited Set:** We'll introduce a set that keeps track of visited states during backward tracing. Before processing a state, we'll check if it has been visited; if so, we'll skip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Pruning:** This will prevent the algorithm from revisiting the same node-direction combination, thus improving time efficiency.\n",

    "- **Corrected Indexing:** The `cost_map` is now indexed correctly using the tuple structure `((x, y), direction)`.\n",
    "- **General Structure:** The approach is similar, but ensures accurate referencing and accumulation of state data during computation.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** The corrected indexing helps ensure that we're consistently interpreting and evaluating the correct states, correcting the efficiency and accuracy of our pathfinding and backtracking approaches.\n",
