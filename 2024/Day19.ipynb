Very suspiciously, absolutely nothing goes wrong as they begin their careful search of the vast field of helixes.\\n\\nCould this finally be your chance to visit the onsen next door? Only one way to find out.\\n\\nAfter a brief conversation with the reception staff at the onsen front desk, you discover that you don't have the right kind of money to pay the admission fee. However, before you can leave, the staff get your attention. Apparently, they've heard about how you helped at the hot springs, and they're willing to make a deal: if you can simply help them arrange their towels, they'll let you in for free!\\n\\nEvery towel at this onsen is marked with a pattern of colored stripes. There are only a few patterns, but for any particular pattern, the staff can get you as many towels with that pattern as you need. Each stripe can be white (w), blue (u), black (b), red (r), or green (g). So, a towel with the pattern ggr would have a green stripe, a green stripe, and then a red stripe, in that order. (You can't reverse a pattern by flipping a towel upside-down, as that would cause the onsen logo to face the wrong way.)\\n\\nThe Official Onsen Branding Expert has produced a list of designs - each a long sequence of stripe colors - that they would like to be able to display. You can use any towels you want, but all of the towels' stripes must exactly match the desired design. So, to display the design rgrgr, you could use two rg towels and then an r towel, an rgr towel and then a gr towel, or even a single massive rgrgr towel (assuming such towel patterns were actually available).\\n\\nTo start, collect together all of the available towel patterns and the list of desired designs (your puzzle input). For example:\\n\\nr, wr, b, g, bwu, rb, gb, br\\n\\nbrwrr\\nbggr\\ngbbr\\nrrbgbr\\nubwu\\nbwurrg\\nbrgr\\nbbrgwb\\nThe first line indicates the available towel patterns; in this example, the onsen has unlimited towels with a single red stripe (r), unlimited towels with a white stripe and then a red stripe (wr), and so on.\\n\\nAfter the blank line, the remaining lines each describe a design the onsen would like to be able to display. In this example, the first design (brwrr) indicates that the onsen would like to be able to display a black stripe, a red stripe, a white stripe, and then two red stripes, in that order.\\n\\nNot all designs will be possible with the available towels. In the above example, the designs are possible or impossible as follows:\\n\\nbrwrr can be made with a br towel, then a wr towel, and then finally an r towel.\\nbggr can be made with a b towel, two g towels, and then an r towel.\\ngbbr can be made with a gb towel and then a br towel.\\nrrbgbr can be made with r, rb, g, and br.\\nubwu is impossible.\\nbwurrg can be made with bwu, r, r, and g.\\nbrgr can be made with br, g, and r.\\nbbrgwb is impossible.\\nIn this example, 6 of the eight designs are possible with the available towel patterns.\\n\\nTo get into the onsen as soon as possible, consult your list of towel patterns and desired designs carefully. How many designs are possible?\"\n",

It checks if the design can be formed using the available patterns. If the design is already in the memo dictionary, it returns that result. If the design is an empty string, it returns `True`.\\n\\n2. **Checking Each Pattern**: For each available towel pattern, check if the current design starts with that pattern. If it does, recursively check if the rest of the design can be formed.\\n\\n3. **Memoization**: Use a memoization dictionary to store results of subproblems to avoid recalculating them.\\n\\n4. **Count Possible Designs**: The function `count_possible_designs` iterates through each design, using the `can_form_design` function to determine if it can be made from the patterns.\\n\\n5. **Output**: Finally, it prints out the number of designs that can be formed.\\n\\nWith this code, you can determine how many of the desired designs can be formed using the available towel patterns.\",\n",

This is a combinatorial problem where we need to find all combinations of patterns that can form the given design.\\n\\nWe can approach this problem using dynamic programming (DP) with memoization.

If it does, recursively calculate the number of ways to form the rest of the design and add that to the total ways.\\n\\n4. **Memoization**: Use memoization to store results for subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\\n\\n5. **Calculate Total Ways**: The `total_ways_for_all_designs` function sums up all possible ways to form each design using the available patterns.\\n\\nBy running this code, you can determine the total number of different ways the towels could be arranged into the given designs to get into the onsen.\",\n",
