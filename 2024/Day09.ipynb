    "        \"text\": \"Another push of the button leaves you in the familiar hallways of some friendly amphipods! Good thing you each somehow got your own personal mini submarine. The Historians jet away in search of the Chief, mostly by driving directly into walls.\\n\\nWhile The Historians quickly figure out how to pilot these things, you notice an amphipod in the corner struggling with his computer. He's trying to make more contiguous free space by compacting all of the files, but his program isn't working; you offer to help.\\n\\nHe shows you the disk map (your puzzle input) he's already generated. For example:\\n\\n2333133121414131402\\n\\nThe disk map uses a dense format to represent the layout of files and free space on the disk. The digits alternate between indicating the length of a file and the length of free space.\\n\\nSo, a disk map like 12345 would represent a one-block file, two blocks of free space, a three-block file, four blocks of free space, and then a five-block file. A disk map like 90909 would represent three nine-block files in a row (with no free space between them).\\n\\nEach file on disk also has an ID number based on the order of the files as they appear before they are rearranged, starting with ID 0. So, the disk map 12345 has three files: a one-block file with ID 0, a three-block file with ID 1, and a five-block file with ID 2. Using one character for each block where digits are the file ID and . is free space, the disk map 12345 represents these individual blocks:\\n\\n0..111....22222\\n\\nThe first example above, 2333133121414131402, represents these individual blocks:\\n\\n00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899\\n\\nThe amphipod would like to move file blocks one at a time from the end of the disk to the leftmost free space block (until there are no gaps remaining between file blocks). For the disk map 12345, the process looks like this:\\n\\n0..111....22222 02.111....2222. 022111....222.. 0221112...22... 02211122..2.... 022111222......\\n\\nThe first example requires a few more steps:\\n\\n00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899 009..111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88889. 0099.111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8888.. 00998111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888... 009981118..2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88.... 0099811188.2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8..... 009981118882...333.44.5555.6666.777....... 0099811188827..333.44.5555.6666.77........ 00998111888277.333.44.5555.6666.7......... 009981118882777333.44.5555.6666........... 009981118882777333644.5555.666............ 00998111888277733364465555.66............. 0099811188827773336446555566..............\\n\\nThe final step of this file-compacting process is to update the filesystem checksum. To calculate the checksum, add up the result of multiplying each of these blocks' position with the file ID number it contains. The leftmost block is in position 0. If a block contains free space, skip it instead.\\n\\nContinuing the first example, the first few blocks' position multiplied by its file ID number are 0 * 0 = 0, 1 * 0 = 0, 2 * 9 = 18, 3 * 9 = 27, 4 * 8 = 32, and so on. In this example, the checksum is the sum of these, 1928.\\n\\nCompact the amphipod's hard drive using the process he requested. What is the resulting filesystem checksum? (Be careful copy/pasting the input for this puzzle; it is a single, very long line.)\"\n",

Second, the computer is running much more slowly! Maybe introducing all of that file system fragmentation was a bad idea?\\n\\nThe eager amphipod already has a new plan: rather than move individual blocks, he'd like to try compacting the files on his disk by moving whole files instead.\\n\\nThis time, attempt to move whole files to the leftmost span of free space blocks that could fit the file. Attempt to move each file exactly once in order of decreasing file ID number starting with the file with the highest file ID number. If there is no span of free space to the left of a file that is large enough to fit the file, the file does not move.\\n\\nThe first example from above now proceeds differently:\\n\\n00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899\\n0099.111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8888..\\n0099.1117772...333.44.5555.6666.....8888..\\n0099.111777244.333....5555.6666.....8888..\\n00992111777.44.333....5555.6666.....8888..\\n\\nThe process of updating the filesystem checksum is the same; now, this example's checksum would be 2858.\\n\\nStart over, now compacting the amphipod's hard drive using this new method instead.

This is typically done by `range(num_files - 1, -1, -1)` which goes from the highest index to 0 inclusive. If you mean \\\"move all files even if they have no ID\\\", that could start from `num_files`, considering there might be an implicit zero ID block defined, starting from `num_files` in reverse to include all indices down to zero.\\n\\nWith this correction, the function properly starts processing from the file with the highest ID down to the lowest, ensuring all files are considered during the compaction.\",\n",
