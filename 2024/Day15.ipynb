If there is a box either the left tile ([) or the right tile (]) then the robot tries to move the box in the direction it is moving. If the tile next to the box of both squares is empty the box moves. If the tile next to the box is another box either right or left, this box gets checked as well for the move in the direction given if it hits a box this happens again until it hits an empty tile, then the boxes cluster will move or it hits a wall # then the boxes are stationary and also the robot skips its move\n",
