    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Construction**: As before, connections are represented in a `defaultdict` of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bron-Kerbosch with Pivoting**: This algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm for finding all maximal cliques in a graph. The version with pivoting helps to reduce the number of recursive calls and improves computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maximum Clique Extraction**: After running the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, we extract the largest clique from the accumulated results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output the Password**: The largest clique is sorted, joined with commas, and printed as the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation should be significantly faster for typical input sizes seen in problems like this, leveraging the more efficient clique finding algorithm. However, the problem's computational complexity means it might still be slow on very large graphs, characteristic of NP-complete problems.\n",
